192.168.0.1
Open/Filtered Ports:

80/tcp (HTTP):
Risk: If HTTPS is not enforced, unencrypted data can be intercepted. Default or misconfigured web servers can expose vulnerabilities.

1900/tcp (UPnP):
Risk: Universal Plug and Play is often exploited for internal network discovery or DDoS amplification. Should be disabled if not needed.

23/tcp (Telnet) - Filtered:
Risk: Even if filtered, the presence of Telnet suggests it may be accessible. Telnet is insecure due to lack of encryption and should be disabled.

192.168.0.106
Filtered Port:

5060/tcp (SIP):
Risk: Used for VoIP. Susceptible to spam calls, registration hijacking, or denial-of-service attacks if exposed.

192.168.0.107
Open Ports:

1077/tcp (imgames):
Risk: Unknown or custom services can introduce vulnerabilities if not properly secured.

3000/tcp (ppp):
Risk: Commonly used by development servers (e.g., Node.js). Should not be exposed in production.

3001/tcp (Nessus):
Risk: Nessus web interface can expose scanning data or configuration. Should be protected with authentication and access control.

7000/tcp (afs3-fileserver):
Risk: File services can leak data or be used for unauthorized access if not secured.

9080/tcp (glrpc):
Risk: Possibly a custom RPC service. Needs review and access restriction.

11111/tcp (vce):
Risk: Very uncommon port. Could be a proprietary serviceâ€”requires evaluation and possibly firewall restriction.

192.168.0.103
Open Ports:

135/tcp (MS RPC):
Risk: Frequently exploited for lateral movement in Windows environments. Should be blocked externally.

139/tcp (NetBIOS-SSN):
Risk: Can expose file sharing and other internal services to attackers.

445/tcp (Microsoft-DS / SMB):
Risk: High risk. Commonly targeted by malware and ransomware (e.g., WannaCry). Should not be exposed to untrusted networks.

4343/tcp (unicall):
Risk: Unknown service; should be audited or disabled if not in use.

4449/tcp (privatewire):
Risk: Uncommon or custom application. Needs review.

192.168.0.104 and 192.168.0.110
No open ports. These systems appear secure from a network exposure standpoint based on this scan.
